Introduction
-----------------
[Mask Scoring R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.00241.pdf) contains a network block to learn the quality of the predicted instance masks. The proposed network block takes the instance feature and the corresponding predicted mask together to regress the mask IoU. The mask scoring strategy calibrates the misalignment between mask quality and mask score, and improves instance segmentation performance by prioritizing more accurate mask predictions during COCO AP evaluation. By extensive evaluations on the COCO dataset, Mask Scoring R-CNN brings consistent and noticeable gain with different models and different frameworks. The network of MS R-CNN is as follows:

Visualization
-------------
![alt text](demo/demo.png)
The left four images show good detection results with high classification scores but low mask quality. Our method aims at solving this problem. The rightmost image shows the case of a good mask with a high classification score. Our method will retrain the high score. As can be seen, scores predicted by our model can better interpret the actual mask quality.
